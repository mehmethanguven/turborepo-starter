## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `next-app`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `next-docs`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) docs
- `next-server`: Node.js server
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `packages/tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `packages/config`: shared `tailwindcss`, `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next`, `eslint-config-prettier`, `eslint-plugin-prettier` etc..)

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd turbo-starter
yarn run build

```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd turbo-starter
yarn run dev
```

### Testing

To test all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd turbo-starter
yarn run test
# test only one app
yarn run test --filter=next-app
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd turbo-starter
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
